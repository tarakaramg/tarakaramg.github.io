          Advisor - Alley Stoughton
            - During the internship, I developed a testsuite for maintaining ucDSL.
          This involves developing a test description language
          (using Menhir) that automatically executes the corresponding test and generates an elaborate
          report. Part of the challenge is in supporting extensive exception/error handling.
          Future work includes translating ucDSL programs into EasyCryptâ€™s procedural programming language and proving that
          the translation is semantically preserving.
          The project also involved writing formal proofs in EasyCrypt proof assistant.

      - title: Mechanized Certified Adversarial Robustness (Working Paper)
        link: "https://github.com/jtassarotti/val"
        tagline:  "We present a complete mechanized proof of the robustness guarantee of classifiers by Cohen et
		   al. The proof has been developed in Coq. Since the original proof relies on inverse CDF of the
		   standard Gaussian distribution and any implementation of the Gaussian distributions involves
		   some way of rounding a real number to the nearest floating point which may introduce rounding
		   errors. These rounding errors can be significant enough that implementation of the classifier may
		   not carry the theoretical robustness. The challenge here is to extend robustness guarantees to the
		   implementation. Our approach relies on two key insights: first, relying on a formally verified
		   external sampler and second, modeling the robustness result using discrete Gaussian distribution.
		   We are exploring both directions. Joint work with Joseph Tassarotti. "

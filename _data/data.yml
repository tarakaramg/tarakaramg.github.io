            - During the internship, I developed a testsuite for maintaining ucDSL.
          This involves developing a test description language
          (using Menhir) that automatically executes the corresponding test and generates an elaborate
          report. Part of the challenge is in supporting extensive exception/error handling.
          Future work includes translating ucDSL programs into EasyCrypt’s procedural programming language and proving that
          the translation is semantically preserving.
          The project also involved writing formal proofs in EasyCrypt proof assistant.

            - My primary area of research is Eigen varieties and p-adic L-functions.
                - My dissertation focuses on investigating the behaviour of L_b ideal without knowing the modules of
                  overconvergent modular symbols M+ and M- at p irregular cuspidal CM modular forms of weight 1 and level N.
